Manual order picking e-commerce warehouses encounter high volume and pickers are often subjected to interference and congestion. One way to eliminate such interference and congestion is to form zones and restrict picker movement to zones. Such zone formation creates other overheads since items need to be collected from zones. The purpose of this paper is to explore circumstances where such a zone strategy is beneficial. To do this a comparison of two methods is proposed. The first method is based on a zone formation technique, in which a picker can only pick items from their respective zone, and a separate picker is assigned to transport items from the central repository to the shipping area. The second method considers the entire warehouse to be a single zone where pickers can pick items and bring them back directly to the shipping area; here pickers are subject to congestion. To analyze the effectiveness of both methods, order arrivals (each of which consist of one or more items) are simulated across a suitable number of replications and summary statistics are obtained. Further, different scenarios are simulated to study the impact of factors like size of the warehouse, number of zones and, number of items in each order, with the goal of identifying the circumstances under which the zone policy is superior.
